# Blogger
======================================

Code for the web-browser based game "Blogger". An arcade-style game which makes use of the navigational arrow keys on the keyboard to manoeuvre a character to the goal destination, whilst avoiding the obstacles on the way. The project was 
written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was completed as part of my Sparta Global training in order to demonstrate the skills acquired from said training, thus far.

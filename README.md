# Blogger

Code for the web-browser based game "Blogger". An arcade-style game which makes use of the navigational arrow keys on the keyboard to manoeuvre a character to the goal destination, whilst avoiding the obstacles on the way. The project was 
written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This was completed as part of my Sparta Global training in order to demonstrate the skills acquired from said training, thus far.

## Instructions
These can also be found within the game.  

1. Use the arrow keys to manoeuvre Billy.

2. Your aim is to cross to the road, dodging all cars in the process.

3. Points are awarded upon entry of the cafe located at the top of the game screen.

4. Each successful run awards 10 points, which can be found in the top right-hand corner of the screen.

5. Be Careful, however, as score hits 30, you'll have to deal with two way traffic!

6. Should you be hit by a car 3 times in a row, it is game over.

7. Your lives counter can be found in the top left-hand corner of the screen.

8. Good Luck!
